# Welcome to Onliine!
The website that simulates the Wii System to perfection (almost).

## Collaborations
I'm open to collaborations! Come and join [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/qMdZZkps2E)
for the project and have a chat with all of us enthusiasts of this project.

## Status
This project is on its early development phase, meaning that is quite incomplete,
might contain errors, has poorly written code and hence I will not focus on performance at the moment.
The project is on a hiatus until I deploy the next update due to me needing to concentrate on ~~my
ongoing school course~~ university. New stuff coming this summer.

Visit [this website](https://jerosajose.github.io/res/sysver.txt) to check the latest version available.

## Updater
While you tinker with the source code, make sure to visit regularly the Settings page, which is
in fact an update checker that syncs with my server for new updates and versions to download
from the GitHub repository.

The update method is completely manual, meaning you just have to download the source code
and merge the new files into your previously/outdated downloaded folder.
